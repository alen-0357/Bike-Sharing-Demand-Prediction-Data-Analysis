# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the daily demand for shared bikes using historical rental data from BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service. The insights gained help the company understand the factors influencing demand and drive business strategies.

## 📝 Problem Statement
BoomBikes wants to identify the significant factors affecting bike demand and how well these factors explain the demand. The model should help the company optimize its operations as business resumes after the COVID-19 lockdown.

## 🚀 Project Structure
- **1. Data Understanding & Exploration:**
  - Loaded and inspected the dataset from `day.csv`
  - Analyzed data structure, types, and summary statistics
  - Explored features and their relationships with demand

- **2. Data Visualization:**
  - Created plots using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to understand trends and correlations
  - Checked for multicollinearity using heatmaps and pair plots
  - Visualized demand variations based on season, weather, and holidays

- **3. Data Preparation:**
  - Handled missing values and duplicates
  - Converted categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding
  - Scaled numeric features for model compatibility

- **4. Model Building & Evaluation:**
  - Built a **Linear Regression** model to predict bike demand
  - Evaluated model performance using R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
  - Identified significant predictors using p-values and VIF scores

## 💡 Skills Learned
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Analysis:** Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
- **Machine Learning:** Linear regression modeling and evaluation
- **Statistical Concepts:** Correlation, VIF, R-squared
- **Problem-Solving:** Overcoming data preparation challenges

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- **Linear Regression:** Built the primary prediction model
- **Regularization:** Used Ridge/Lasso regression to reduce overfitting
- **Model Evaluation:** Applied metrics like R² and Adjusted R²

## ✅ Challenge and Solution Example
**Problem:** The linear regression model could not interpret categorical variables like `season` and `weather`.

**Solution:** Applied **one-hot encoding** using `pd.get_dummies()` to convert categorical features into numerical ones. This improved model performance and interpretability.
